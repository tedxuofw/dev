As a person with a disability, she is passionate about researching, educating, and writing about ableism, or disability prejudice. Her research focuses on the psychosocial implications of living with disability, rare disorders, or facial differences such as Moebius syndrome. An advocate for people with disabilities, she has served on the American Psychological Association Committee on Disability Issues in Psychology, the Rehabilitation Psychology editorial board, and the Moebius Syndrome Foundation Scientific Advisory Board.</p><p>She is a 2021 Public Voices Fellow with the OpEd Project. Her work has been featured in the New York Times, Time, The Conversation, the Financial Times, and Huffington Post, and she blogs for Psychology Today at https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/disability-is-diversity. In 2019, she co-edited the Journal of Social Issues special issue on Ableism. Dr. Bogart presents internationally to academic, general, and stakeholder audiences about disability awareness, disability as diversity, and facial paralysis. She consults with organizations on disability advocacy.</p><p>Twitter: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/kathleen_bogart\" style=\"color: #e62b1e;\">@kathleen_bogart</a><br>Blog: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/disability-is-diversity\" style=\"color: #e62b1e;\">Disability is Diversity</a></p>'\n        ),\n        makeSpeaker(\n          'Lexi Walls',\n          'The Future of Pandemic Preparedness',\n          '<p>Dr. Lexi Walls grew up in Massachusetts and moved to Seattle to start graduate school and follow both her scientific and hiking dreams. She started studying coronaviruses in 2015: learning what they looked like, how they functioned, and what kinds of therapeutics could be useful. She had no idea that her years of work would help prepare her and the scientific and medical communities for the COVID-19 pandemic. She is currently a scientist at the University of Washington working on next generation vaccines and therapeutics against this current pandemic as well as against potential future ones. She works hard to make sure that the work she and others are doing can be communicated to the broad public, and has spoken at high schools, community colleges, universities, on podcasts, and at Seattle town hall to share the work with the community. She spends her free time exploring the beautiful mountains of the Pacific Northwest.</p><p>Twitter: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/coronalexington\" style=\"color: #e62b1e;\">@coronalexington</a></p>'\n        )\n      ],\n      performers: [\n        makeSpeaker(\n          'Liv Victorino',\n          'TBD',\n          '<p>Liv Victorino, a junior at UW, is an indie-folk guitarist and singer/songwriter, as well as the drummer for local all-girl rock band Cherry Tomato.

Some of their poetic influences include Maya Angelou, Robert Frost, and Hanif Abdurraqib. Their art is meant to unite those going through similar experiences and enlighten those who are not. She also hopes her poetry can help give a bigger voice to marginalized people. Poetry is meant to help individuals on their journey towards self-love and create a different worldview for those searching for it. Adriane hopes their work can inspire others to express themselves and speak their truth.</p><p>Instagram: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/awats.adriane/?hl=en\" style=\"color:
